            <li>1 sheet of puff pastry (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>250 ml (1 cup) whole milk</li>
            <li>g (2 tbsp) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>50 g (1¼ cups) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>125 ml (½ cup) water</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>1 strip of lemon peel (just the yellow part)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 250°C (480°F).</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, cinnamon stick, and lemon peel. Bring to a boil and cook until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and discard cinnamon and lemon peel.</li>
            <li>In another saucepan, whisk flour into milk and cook over medium heat until thickened and smooth.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the sugar syrup into the milk-flour mixture, whisking constantly. Let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks into the cooled mixture until fully combined and smooth.</li>
            <li>Roll out the puff pastry and cut into circles to fit a muffin tin. Press pastry into the tin, making sure it comes up the sides.</li>
            <li>Fill each pastry shell with custard mixture, about ¾ full.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15–20 minutes until the tops are caramelized and the pastry is golden.</li>
            <li>Let cool slightly before serving. Optionally, sprinkle with cinnamon or powdered sugar.</li>
        </ol>
